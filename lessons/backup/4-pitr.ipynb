    "Notes:\n",
    "- Since CHECKPOINTS are performed often and a backup is taking time, the particular CHECKPOINT should be stored separately (backup_label file) from pg_control because other CHECKPOINTS can be performed during backup\n",
    "- Backups can have a label (name)\n",
    "- Backup history file is replacing backup label because the backup WAL files are already archived after `pg_backup_stop` which calls `pg_switch_wal`.\n",
    "- Backup history name is determined by the actual WAL file and LSN that should be applied first after restoring the physical backup\\\n",
    "In a format: `%wal_file_name.%lsn.backup` something like: `0000000100001234000055CD.007C9330.backup`"
