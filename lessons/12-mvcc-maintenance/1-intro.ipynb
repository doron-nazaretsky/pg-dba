    "As mentioned in MVCC module, an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` of a row does not immediately remove the old version of the row because it is still potentially visible to other transactions.\\\n",
    "But eventually, an outdated or deleted row version is no longer of interest to any transaction. The space it occupies must then be reclaimed for reuse by new rows, to avoid unbounded growth of disk space requirements and improve performance (more rows with less I/O)."
