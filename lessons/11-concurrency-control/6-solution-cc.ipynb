    "- Optimistic - No locks, only check for violations of the integrity rules at each transaction's commit. If violations are detected upon a transaction's commit, the transaction is aborted and restarted. This approach is very efficient when few transactions are aborted.\n",
    "- Pessimistic - Use locks, block an operation of a transaction, if it may cause violation of the rules, until the possibility of violation disappears. Blocking operations is typically involved with performance reduction.\n",
    "- Semi-optimistic - Responds pessimistically or optimistically depending on the type of violation and how quickly it can be detected."
